This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem. The "test" folder first contains R Markdown files with unnamed chunks. After running `name_dir_chunks`, they're all named, with names using the filenames as basis.

``` r
fs::dir_copy(system.file("examples", package = "namer"),
            "test")
name_dir_chunks("test")
file.edit("test/example1.Rmd")
```

There's also `name_chunks()` for use on a single R Markdown file; and `unname_chunks()` to unname all chunks of a single R Markdown file as well as `unname_dir_chunks()` to unname all chunks of all R Markdown files in a directory, which can be useful when cleaning your chunk labels.

By default `unname_chunks()` unnames all chunks with exception of the 'setup' chunk. By using the argument `chunk_name_prefix` one can indicate the prefix of the labels that will be unnamed. Useful when one refers to a label by using chunk option `ref.label` so that it is inconvenient when that labeel is unnamed. By setting `chunk_name_prefix` equal to 'the filename with extension stripped' followed with a '-' (dash) only the labels generated by `name_chunks()` will be unnamed.

If you're working with RStudio, installing the package will have installed an addin for labelling chunks of *any R Markdown document you select*.

**When using `namer`, please check the edits before pushing them to your code base. Such automatic chunk labelling is best paired with [version control](http://happygitwithr.com/).**
