The goal of {namer} is to name the chunks of R Markdown files. It's your safety net when you've (willingly) forgotten to name most chunks of all R Markdown files in a folder. {namer} does *not* give meaningful labels to your chunks, but it gives them labels that won't change depending on their position like the automatic `knitr:::unnamed_chunk` function does when knitting. So you can e.g. shuffle your chunks and not loose their cache, or more easily debug over a whole folder!

For context about _why_ you should name your R Markdown chunks, read [this blog post](https://masalmon.eu/2017/08/08/chunkpets/).

The screenshot below is [a real life example](https://github.com/lockedata/pres-datascience/pull/1/), result of running `namer::name_dir_chunks("pres")`. In each of the files in the dir "pres", it labelled chunks using the filename and numbers.
